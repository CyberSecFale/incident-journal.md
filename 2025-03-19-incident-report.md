## 🗺️ Situation Overview  

### Incident Timeline  
While monitoring logs via the SIEM dashboard, Ana observed:

- **10 Failed Login Attempts** — indicating possible brute-force activity.
- **Unauthorized External Probe** — an attempt to access systems storing customer PII and banking data.

Recognizing the gravity, Ana prioritized the external probe over failed login attempts, acting swiftly according to established protocols.

## 🚨 Incident Response  

Following client policies and FALE training, Ana:

- Consulted the escalation matrix detailed in the client’s security playbook.
- Elevated the suspicious external access as a **P1** (highest priority) incident.
- Alerted the Incident Response Team via secure communication channels.
- Logged all activities with timestamps for audit purposes.
- Submitted the failed login attempts separately as a **P3** incident to the password management team.

Throughout this process, Ana consulted with FALE Network Solutions for rapid policy validation, ensuring compliance and accuracy. James, a fellow FALE contractor, reviewed the logs and provided insights to ensure proper documentation and response.
